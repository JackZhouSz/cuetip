# Rules

These are two lists of expert-provided rules, collected from the text [The Illustrated Principles of Pool and Billiards](https://archive.org/details/illustratedprinc0000alci) by David Alciatore. The 'value' rules evaluate qualities of a shot that make it valuable for a player to execute. The 'difficulty' rules evaluate qualities of a shot that make it difficult for a player to achieve successfully or to win the game.

Each rule as a corresponding code implementation found in poolagent/domain_expert_info. These are text files containing the python code that gets executed on each shot to evaluate the value or difficulty of the shot.
